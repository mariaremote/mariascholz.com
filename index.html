  <h4>'Surfineer'</h4>
  <h3>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h3>
  <img src="static/profile_pic.png" alt="Surfineer" height="150">
  <p>Welcome to my online portfolio! I am passionate about software engineering and surfering, hence I call myself a "surfineer". For me, this is the perfect life balance; keeping me engaged physically as well as mentally. Both discplines push me constantly for continuous learning and continuous improvement.</p>
  <p>My journey so far has led me to specialize in Python programming including web development frameworks like Flask. As a Google-Fangirl, I have chosen Google's Cloud services (GCP) for hosting my website projects.</p>
  <p>My passion for both coding and surfing has taught me the importance of adaptability and balance in everything I do.</p>
  <p>I invite you to explore my portfolio to see how I've combined my love for coding and surfing to create unique and
  impactful projects. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing my journey with you.</p>
